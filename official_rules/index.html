We will start putting people on auto at 5 o'clock CST after proof has been shown of them being non-responsive or as early as 3 o'clock CST if an early auto is requested. We will put an opponent on auto as soon as we can if proper proof was provided showing that your opponent was 30 mins late for a set game time.
